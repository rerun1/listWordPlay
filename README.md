#### Shopping list with text area to work with sentences
#### _**by Suzi Rubino â€” August 10th, 2019**_
<br>

## Description
Website with a form where users may enter a sentence. Used the previous project, shopping list, and substituted a text area input area for the text input in forms.

Turn that sentence into an array using the split method then loop through this array to build a new array out of every word in the sentence that is 3 or more characters in length.
Finally, reverse the order of the new array, join it back together into a string, and display it to the user.

## Objectives
- [] JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.
- [] Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- [] Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- [ ] Application implements a for loop and works as expected.
All previous objectives have been met.
- [ ] Project is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- [] Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- [] Practice styling with imagery and fonts
